        <p>On behalf of all of us at GenSpark, we want to thank you for being a part of our program!

This survey is our effort to improve what we do. And what better way to gain insight than from those who have first hand experience! We value your opinions and thoughts very seriously, and we want to make positive changes based on your constructive feedback. This is a way for you to shape the future of GenSpark, so thank you for your time!

We know your time is valuable, so as an incentive, we will reward you with a $5 Amazon gift card! There are 3 sections. All in all, it should take about 3-5 min!

Lastly, we're hosting a focus group via video chat to get more in-depth thoughts from people. It will be 45-60 min max. Your video does not have to be on. üòÅ If you'd like to participate, you'll receive an additional $10 Amazon gift card for your participation! 

Thank you for your time and thoughts! üôÇ</p>
